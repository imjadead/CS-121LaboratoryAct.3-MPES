# 🎬 Motion Picture Explorer 🎥

**Hello!!!**  and **Welcome** to the Motion Picture Explorer System! This project is a Python-based console application that lets users interact with a curated library of **Movies**, **Series**, **Documentaries**, and **Short Films** — each with realistic and interactive features.

## 📝 Description 

This Python-based program allows users to explore a categorized list of motion pictures. It supports playing media, viewing basic information, and using specific functions such as:
- Watching trailers (Movies)
- Going to next episodes (Series)
- Narration and viewing statistics (Documentaries)
- Festival features (Short Films)

The program highlights the use of **object-oriented programming** concepts such as **inheritance** to differentiate behavior across media types.

## 📣 How to Run the Program

Once the program starts:

1. You are asked to select the type of motion picture (Movie, Series, Documentary, or Short Film).

2. After selecting a type, a list of titles in that category appears.

3. You can then choose a specific film to interact with.

4. A menu of available actions (e.g., play, get info, watch trailer, etc.) will be displayed.

5. Depending on your selection, appropriate methods specific to the media type are executed.

### This interaction simulates a media library using object-oriented programming, with dynamic behavior for each media category via subclasses. ###
